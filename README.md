# Simple Github API app
With this React/Material UI app you can search users by username. Also by selecting the user you can browse their repositories.

## Structure
As a starting template, more complicated structure was used, hence the folder structure and extra dependencies.

The project includes one page (Github.js), layout components (Layout.js and Navigation.js)
and reusable components (Card.js and Notification.js)

## UI
